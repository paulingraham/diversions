****************

My husband, Robert Philip Ingraham, and I have been married for 56 years. About thirty years ago, I began to study my own family history, but about ten years later, I began to explore his. Although some work had been done by other family members, there was less information about his family than I had had about mine. 

My husband has always complained that his lineage is “all British” and “not very interesting.” But, as with all families, his family has some interesting stories to tell — of courage, hardship, challenge, and adversity. The four surnames of his grandparents are Ingraham, Mosher, Herrick, and Brand. These are the four families I have researched. 

Below is a brief history of each family and then a table of contents.

##The Ingrahams

The Ingrahams seem to have originated from Essex County in eastern England. Richard Ingraham and Elizabeth Wignall are considered to be the first in this family, immigrating to Massachusetts in about 1630. From there, some family members moved on to New York and even further west. Below is a list of the couples in this line. 

* Richard Ingraham (1600-1668) and Elizabeth Wignall (1604-1668)
* William Ingraham (1634-1721) and Mary Barstow (1642-1708)
* Timothy Ingraham (1660-1748) and Sarah Cowell (1660-1743)
* Timothy Ingraham (1691-1768) and Abigail Eddy (1725-1795)
* Jonathan Ingraham (1760-1847) and Mary Howard (1770-1840)
* David Ingraham (1803-1870) and Anna Howard (1812-1860)
* David A. Ingraham (1832-1919) and Harriet Lusty (1834-1919)
* [Franklin Ingraham (1858-1944) and Belle Captola Lee (1866-1919)](franklin-and-belle.html)

* [Robert Mosher Ingraham (1911-1995) and Hazel Marie Herrick (1914-2010)](robert-and-hazel.html)  

##The  Moshers

The Moshers are in the United States even before the Ingrahams. Hugh Mosher is born in Rhode Island in 1633, just three years after Richard Ingraham arrived on colonial soil. The family lived in Rhodes, Massachusetts, and eventually New York state. Below is a list of the couples in this line.

* Hugh Mosher (1633-1713) and Rebecca Maxson (1637-1700)
* Nicholas Mosher (1666-1747) and Elizabeth Audley (1669-1747)
* Nicholas Mosher (1702-1765) and Rebecca Wilcox (1711-AFT 1756)
* Jabez Mosher (1731-1810) and Elizabeth Preston (1733-1810)
* David Mosher (1761-1850) and Sylvia Allen (1767-1840)
* Jabez Mosher (1796-1868) and Elizabeth Doane (1805-1850)
* Josiah Mosher (1834-1924) and Sarah Jane Harrington (1839-1900)
* [George Henry Mosher (1865-1929) and Gertrude Wheeler (1868-1958)](george-and-gertrude.html)
* [Robert Lee Ingraham (1888-1962) and Ratie Jane Mosher (1888-1985)](robert-and-ratie.html)

##The Herricks

Henry Herrick immigrated to Massachusetts from England in the early 1600’s. He settled in Salem, and several generations of Herricks lived there until the infamous Salem Witch Trials. Although some Herricks were involved in the trials (one was the constable; another on the jury), some were not. They left the area and settled in New York state, remaining there for several generations. The following couples are in the Herrick family tree:

* Henry Herrick (1604-1671) and Editha Laskin (1614-1677)
* Ephraim Herrick (1638-1693) and Mary Cross (1640-1670)
* John Herrick (1662-1729) and Bethia Solart (1666-1729)
* John Herrick (1699-1745) and Susanna (1715-1804)
* Eleazer Herrick (1734-ABT 1790) and Mary Rea (1738-1818)
* Rufus Herrick  (1765-1820) and Jerusha Pellet Pierce (1770-1827)
* [Pierce Herrick (1804-1887) and Ann Miller (1806-1872)](pierce-and-ann.html)
* [Augustus C. Herrick (1836-1912) and Josephine Niver (1834-1910)](augustus-and-josephine.html)
* [Bert Herrick (1874-1945) and Grace Mae Brand (1879-1972)](bert-and-grace.html)

##The Brands

The Brands appear in England in the late 1700’s. John Brand never left England but his son, Benjamin, emigrated to Wisconsin and married Abigail Baker King. The Brands moved a lot and finding them in records is difficult. Here are the couples in the Brand Family Tree:

* John Brand (1776-1841) and Margaret Head (ABT 1780-AFT 1803)
* Benjamin Brand (1803-1882) and Abigail Baker King (1808-1855)
* Baker Brand (1826-1903) and Sarah Ann Higby (1831-1904)
* Samuel Perkins Brand (1849-1925) and Martha Elizabeth Hatch (1855-1933)
* [Bert Herrick (1874-1945) and Grace Mae Brand (1879-1972)](bert-and-grace.html)
