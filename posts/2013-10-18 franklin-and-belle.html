<!-- 8, 9  -->

##Another Generation in New York State

Franklin Ingraham was born 20 Mar 1858, most likely in Andover, Allegany County, New York. As a 6-year-old boy, in 1864, he was living with his mother in Greenwood, Steuben County, New York. The family was nearly destitute while his father, David A. Ingraham, was away fighting in the Civil War. 

Franklin was usually called Frank and also nicknamed Hank. He was the third of ten children born to David Alman Ingraham and Harriet Lusty.

Frank can be found in the 1860 Census, just a baby of two years of age living with his parents, and in the 1880 Census, a bachelor living as a boarder with the Norton family in Canadice, Ontario, New York. He is also in the New York State Census for 1865. That Census reveals his parents -- David and Harriet -- as well as his siblings: Robert, 9; Mary 5; and Minnie, 0. 

##Marriage, Sons and a Daughter

!sidebar
Belle‘s grandfather, Davis Lee and his wife, Amy Hull, had settled in Allegany County in 1818. Belle was the daughter of Davis B. Lee (Jr.) and Julia (surname unknown). She is <em>not</em> related to the Confederate Civil War General, Robert E. Lee. 

Frank married Belle Captola Lee in 1885 in Andover, Allegany County, New York. Belle was born 27 April 1866 in Andover; she was nearly eight years younger than her husband. She was called Belle or Captola, depending on who was taling to her. 

Frank and Belle can be found in the 1900, 1910, and 1920 censuses living in Andover with their children.

Allegany County was first formed in 1683, but it was divided up several times between 1760 and 1770.  Andover — which lies on the eastern border of the county — was formed from the city of Independence in 1824. The land is hilly and was once covered with pine forests. Dykes Creek and Elm Creek flow through the county; the soil is best for grazing. Pine lumber was manufactured there for many years, but that is gone now; dairy farms are the main agricultural endeavour.

Frank and Belle Captola had three children:

*  <span class='blue'>Harry D. Ingraham</span> b. 1891

franklin-and-belle-and-son.jpeg		ds  	FOUR GENERATIONS POSE FOR A PHOTOGRAPH From left to right: Julia Lee (probably Belle Captola's mother); Belle Captola Lee Ingraham (mother of Robert Lee Ingraham); Robert Lee Ingraham (oldest son of Belle Captola and Frank Ingraham); Lee Wheeler Ingraham (the first son of Robert Lee Ingraham and his wife, Ratie Jane Mosher)

In some writings by Robert Lee Ingraham, Frank and Belle's older son, he says: "When I was about 6 years old my parents gave up farming and moved to the town of Andover, New York. ...an epidemic of diptheria swept the school and I along with a lot of others caught it. My mother and younger brother contracted it from me but luckily none of us died. My mother, who was a very pretty woman, lost her voice and all of her beautiful long chestnut hair came out and for the next ten years she wore a wig and could only whisper. Those were dark days."

As Belle's hair is quite short in the above photograph, one can assume that it was taken perhaps during those ten years. Or even later. Perhaps she never gained back "beautiful long chestnut hair."

##Ending Life where It Began

It would appear that both Frank and Belle were born, lived, and died in Andover, New York. Belle died there after 1920, but the exact date of her death is, as yet, unknown.

Belle died 19 February 1920, but Frank lived on for more than twenty years, passing away on 30 May 1944, when he was 86 years old. Both were buried in Andover, Allegany County, New York. However, Frank has not yet been found in the Census records beyond 1920.
