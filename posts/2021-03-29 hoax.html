<span class='blue'>**NOTE: My mother's brother, my Uncle Bill, participated in many of the major battles of the European theatre during World War II. This page and others reveal his experiences. For a full listing, see the bottom of this page. The photo at left is one of the rare photos I have of my uncle. It was taken after the war.**</span>

##The Hoax on the Sergeant

*My Uncle Bill loved a practical joke. I am not someone who likes practical jokes, so this part of my uncle's personality never particularly appealed to me. But he was capable of some elaborate ruses. Even during a war, he found ways to play tricks on people. I find myself wondering if this entire story is true, or if there's just a little bit of exaggeration on my uncle's part. Whatever the truth is, it does make for a pretty good story.*

"One thing we did in camp was pull a gigantic hoax on [one of our sergeants]. He was a womanizer. He had a lovely wife and twins at home but he had to chase every skirt anywhere."

"[Prior to his coming to Europe, the sergeant] had been sent to personnel school at Philadelphia and started dating a girl there. The only way he could get her to bed was to propose marriage to her and buy her a ring. Then, of course, he was transferred back to the 981st and goodbye girlfriend in Philadelphia." 

##The Plan

*Perhaps Bill wanted the sergeant to think a little bit about his behaviour and the consequences of those behaviours.*

"I made up dozens of letters, papers, official documents, etc., making up a big story that this girl was pregnant, from a good Philadelphia family, and the family wanted [the sergeant] returned to Philadelphia to marry the girl.

"I got official stationery from ETOUSA [European Theatre of Operations, United States Army], First Army, Seventh Corps, 142nd Group, etc., and even got the papers officially stamped when I made trips to [these offices], etc. [Another sergeant] and I folded the papers, and refolded them, got the oldest ones a little soiled to look official. Boy, were we going to have fun...

"The [fake] papers from the Pentagon on down said, 'Unless [the sergeant] is absolutely essential to the war effort, return him to Philadelphia immediately.' 

"The final decision was to be made by the commanding officer of the 981st FA Bn. [My co-conspirator] and I gave these papers to...the man who operated the Message Centre [and] who delivered all official messages and the mail. He started reading and started laughing. What a good joke! Soon tears were running down his eyes. What a joke!"

##The Sergeant Becomes the Target

*Bill and his friends finally came to the day when they knew that the sergeant would receive the letters.*

"When it was time [for the Message Centre] to deliver official papers, in came the Major. He had the papers: He stood [the sergeant] to attention, read him a riot act, chewed him up one side and down the other, and I knew I was probably facing a courts martial. Something had gone wrong. 

"How did those papers get into the Major's hands? [Once everyone started laughing, the Major asked what was going on.] The Major...liked a good joke and so he took them to the Colonel who said, 'Oh, boy, let me play with this too.'

"So the Colonel came in and said to [the sergeant], 'You’re going to Philadelphia.' 

"[The sergeant] pleaded, 'You know I’m married. I have twins. I love my family.'
	
"Well,' said the colonel, 'You’re going to apologize to that girl and her family. And you’re going to support that child.'

##Fortunately, the joke came to an end.

*At some point, the joke had to end. When it did, perhaps not a lot was learned.*

"Well, the joke went so far; we had [the sergeant] in his best uniform, in a jeep, ready to go to an airport to fly to the States when we told him it was all a joke. [The sergeant] said he would live the straight and narrow path forever and 'forever'— which for him was about three days."
